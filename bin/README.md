# CamCoordinate
This project is a hobby I work on in my (limited) free time between work and school. This repo doesn't look like much at the moment; however, I've got lots of notes and ideas!

## Break-down

One of the problems my coworkers have is organizing the countless pictures needed for property management. We need pictures for move-ins, move-outs, marketing, maintenance, and much more! While organizing pictures doesn't sound difficult, it can be quite the challenge when you have as many as we do. Sifting through pictures from a few dozen properties taken over the course of a week is a tall order alone, much less putting them in the correct network drive locations. With CamCoordinate I want to solve this problem!

## Issues to Tackle
- Grouping pictures (Auto & Manual)
- Storing pictures in specific destinations
- Store path data in database of some sort (DB file/SQL server)

## The How
This program, especially being a hobby, means that I have no extremely specific plans. I'll keep updating this README file as I know more but this is what I know now:

I'm using Java just because it has a special place in my heart. I love it! Garbage collection, objects, no pointers, what's not to love?

I want this program to be cross-platform compatible, responsive, and user-friendly. Luckily with the JVM and JavaFX, a large part of this will be fairly simple.

The dream is to have this program parse what's on an SD card or what's in a directory, find the photos, and help group them based on when they were taken. From there a user would be able to specify which records in the database the photos belong to and the program would take care of moving all of the photos to their respective locations.

More to come!
